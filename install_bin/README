[ Installation ]

To install, execute the installer.sh file within this directory. This installer will create the initial database for Eucalyptus with the built-in Administrator and an example FlightPlan.

The default built-in Administrator credentials are:
u: admin
p: rtteuc123

The installer.sh script creates a backup of all mongodb databases first. In the event the installer overwrites any databases, the backups are stored within the 'dump' directory.

---------------

[ Uninstallation ]

To remove the eucalyptus database from MongoDB, simply run the remove_db.sh script.
