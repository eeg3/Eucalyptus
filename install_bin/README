[ Installation ]

To install, execute the installer.js file within this directory. This installer will create the initial database for Eucalyptus with an example FlightPlan, as well as configure Eucalyptus.

The installer.sh script creates a backup of all mongodb databases first. In the event the installer overwrites any databases, the backups are stored within the 'dump' directory.

---------------

[ Uninstallation ]

To remove the eucalyptus database from MongoDB, simply run the remove_db.sh script.
