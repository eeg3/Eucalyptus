# ToDo Listening

=== Change system to be more of a framework and less static ===

1. Create an API for document sections
  - documentModel
    - id
    - category
    - name
    - title
    - steps
      - Make steps reference a document.cfg file that has all the build info for the step
    - status

2. Change main page to pull from document API
  - Cycle through documents and find all categories
  - Create a panel for each category
  - Add a row for each document into each category
